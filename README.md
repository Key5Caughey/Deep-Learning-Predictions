# Deep-Learning-Challenge-21

### In this challenge I had to take a csv file containing metadata for over 34,000 organizations that recieved funding from the Alphabet Soup nonprofit foundation and build a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success.

### Preprocess Data
 Read in the charity_data.csv file,identify targets and features for model. Drop columns with irrelevant data. Use get dummies to encode categorical variables, split into features array and target array. Split into training and testing datasets.

### Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
 Create neural network, choose hidden layers, neuron amount, epochs,output layer and appropiate activation function. Compile and train model, evaluate test data, export results to an HDF5 file.

### Optimize the Model
  Adjust model, dropping columns, add or reduce neurons/epochs/hidden layers, use different activation functions.

### Report on Model
 Overview, Results, Summary

### Libraries/ Modules
sklearn.model_selection/preprocessing, pandas, tensorflow.keras.models/layers

### Resources
Class notes, Office hours, Tutor, Chatgpt
